## Network graphs for evolutionary trajectories 36_37 and 20_39.

The networks were created by running “create_network.py” with the input files “20_39 EC50s.csv” and “36_37 EC50s.csv”. For each input file, this generated files to describe the edges and nodes of a graph. The edges and nodes were imported into Cytoscape 3.8.0 and arranged into a graph containing the same number of mutations in each column. 

The final networks are saved as "Networks_20-39_36-37.cys"

**Files:**
* Networks_20-39_36-37.cys - the cytoscape file containing the completed networks
* create_network.py - python script used to create nodes and edges for Cytoscape
* 20_39 EC50s.csv and 36_37 EC50s.csv - the input files for creating the graphe
* 20_39_nodes.csv and 36_37_nodes.csv - files containing nodes for Cytoscape
* 20_39_edges.csv and 36_37_edges.csv - files containing edges for Cytoscape
