The script “create_network.py” was run with the input files “20_39 EC50s.csv” and “36_37 EC50s.csv”. For each input file, this generated files to describe the edges and nodes of a graph.  The edges and nodes were imported into Cytoscape 3.8.0 and arranged into a graph containing the same number of mutations in each column. 

Files:
*Networks_20-39_36-37.cys - the cytoscape file containing the completed networks
